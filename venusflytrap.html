            <p>
                The Venus’s-flytrap is a plant that traps and eats insects. It belongs to a group of carnivorous, or meat-eating, plants.
                This group also includes sundews and pitcher plants. 
                The scientific name of the Venus’s-flytrap is Dionaea muscipula.
                In the wild the Venus’s-flytrap grows only in parts of North and South Carolina, in the United States. 
                It grows best in soil that is damp.
                The Venus’s-flytrap is a small plant that grows from a bulblike root. 
                It reaches heights of between 8 and 12 inches (20 to 30 centimeters) and produces small, white flowers. 
                The leaves of the plant grow in rounded halves. 
                The halves are hinged together on one side like jaws. 
                Each half has long spikes along its edge and three hairs on top that are sensitive to touch. 
                The leaf oozes a sticky substance that attracts flies and other insects.
                When an insect crawls between the two halves of a leaf, the hairs detect its presence. 
                In less than a second, the leaf snaps shut and the long spikes lock together. 
                Once the insect is trapped, the leaf releases enzymes, or digestive juices.
                These juices break down the insect into nutrients. 
                The leaf absorbs the nutrients and transports them to all parts of the plant. 
                This process takes about 10 days. Then the leaf reopens.
